# javascript-challenge

This repository contains two folders UFO-level-1 and UFO-level-2 . Each contains a basic HTML web page or use [index.html] and folders [images] containing the images, [css] format, and [js] containing UFO dataset [data.js]data and the javascript code [app.js].

The app.js provides the code to create a dinamic table. In addition the code allows the user to filter the data based on the variable `date/time`.  The UFO-level-2 contains the same architecture but the user can filter by the following variables:  
  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`

Enjoy the html and the UFO reports!!
